If you perform enough acts that are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities that come from the druid class, including your primal spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone} ritual.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">The following acts are anathema to all druids:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using metal armor or shields.</li>\n<li>Despoiling natural places.</li>\n<li>Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts, detailed in the order's entry.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">See specific orders for more information.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>\n<h2>Druidic Language</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">You know Druidic, a secret language known to only druids, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids is anathema.</p>\n<h2>Druidic Order</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Selecting druid feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Orders can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.POBvoXifa9HaejAg]{Animal}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.u4nlOzPj2WHkIj9l]{Leaf}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.acqqlYmti8D9QJi0]{Storm}, and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.v0EjtiwdeMj8ykI0]{Wild}).</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies, representing your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Primal Spellcasting</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">The power of the wild world flows through you. You can cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list in this book, or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3-11: Druid Spells per Day.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of druid spell slot you have.
